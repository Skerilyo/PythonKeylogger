# PythonKeylogger

Project inspired from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHrNlAF0Y0
I just added and udp server/client for it to work from one computer to another
And i wrote a very little bash script to make it easy to launch on any linux computer that has python3 and pip installed
Might upgrade it later
